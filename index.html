      <h4>why programming</h4>
      <p>Computer coding/programming is the universal language of the planet. People who know how to code will be able to communicate across countries and cultures, be innovative, and solve problems more efficiently, with no barriers to impede their success. Learning programming at a young age helps your children solve everyday problems and get set up for a lifetime of opportunities.
        <br>
          <em>computational thinking</em> is the ability to communicate your thoughts in a structured and logical way. This type of thought process is like the step by step instructions that are coded into a computer. It is also the process of thinking up and then solving problems in a methodical way that could be replicated by a machine. Software engineers, computer programmers, and logistics specialists use this method of thinking to solve problems. Computational thinking is a combination of advanced mathematics, algorithm development and logic. The development of computational thinking involves considering a problem and breaking it down into single-action steps. Each of these steps is handled in the most efficient way possible. There is also an element of abstraction in computational thinking, which allows your child to move from a specific solution to a specific problem and generalize it to other situations. The result is a paradigm shift in thinking about how the world works.
